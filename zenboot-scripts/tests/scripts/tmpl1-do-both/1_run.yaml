#
# It is possible to reference other script in other folders by adding YAML files to the scriptlet stack.
#
# A property "lookupPath" can be set which defines where Zenboot should look for such scripts.
# The local script-folder is always added to the lookup path.
# Zenboot will iterate through the lookup bath in the same order as defined and try to find the script
# by appending the lookup path in front of the script name. First hit wins. Lookup-path values can be relative or absolute.
#
# The property "scripts" contains a list of scripts which will be added to the scriptlet stack. The scripts will be introduce
# in the same order as they are listed and replace the YAML-file in the scriptlet stack.
#
lookupPath:
  - ../tmpl1-do-something
  - ../tmpl1-do-something-else
scripts:
  - do-something.yaml
  - do-something-else.yaml
